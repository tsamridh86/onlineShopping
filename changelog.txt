changelog:

modifications done on : 
1. config.php	--> extended the items table and added a time calculating function.
2. welcomePage.php	--> extended the now trending table, added the bidding side by side.
3. searchPage.php --> added brandwise searching in the search bar, extended the display for time remaining
4. sellerPage.php --> ability to add deadline for bidding items.

the items on bid have a deadLine attribute to them, basically, this when no other customer can bid for that product and that product will be ordered with quantity 1.

also, since the product needs to stop circulation after the deadLine is complete, it's status will be automatically alloted as D that is the deactivated state, i.e., the product will remain inside the server but it cannot be accessed anymore.
	(When the admin approves of the product, it's status changes from N to Y, so reverting it back to N is also an option, but sincem thw query we use for unapproved items uses select * bla bla bla where status = 'N'. This forces us to use a new status D.)
