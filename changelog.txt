changelog:

modifications done on : 
1. config.php	--> extended the items table and added a time calculating function.
2. welcomePage.php	--> extended the now trending table, added the bidding side by side.
3. searchPage.php --> added brandwise searching in the search bar, extended the display for time remaining
4. sellerPage.php --> ability to add deadline for bidding items.(deadline can be added to selling items also, but it would have no effect.)
5. orderPage.php --> extended to display the time remaining.
6. adminPage.php --> adjusted the display for time remaining.

at line number 91 there is a code to check whether the outdated item is still being displayed in the screen & hence appropiate measures are taken to remove it


the items on bid have a deadLine attribute to them, basically, this when no other customer can bid for that product and that product will be ordered with quantity 1.

also, since the product needs to stop circulation after the deadLine is complete, it's status will be automatically alloted as D that is the deactivated state, i.e., the product will remain inside the server but it cannot be accessed anymore.
	(When the admin approves of the product, it's status changes from N to Y, so reverting it back to N is also an option, but since the query we use for unapproved items uses select * bla bla bla where status = 'N'. This forces us to use a new status D.)

	query run:
	alter table items add column deadLine int default NULL;
	update items set deadLine = 1466978400 where type = 'B' and deadLine = NULL;

added a new function:
calcTime($deadLine)
	this functions calculates the time remaining to approach the deadline (given in the parameter) w.r.t the current date.
in config.php line 11 :
$_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME'] is used to retrieve the current time (probably GMT, it may not be local time (GMT + 5:45))
subtract the given deadline from the current time,
if the answer is negative, the time is overdue & hence we return 0 (line 13)
if the answer is positive, there is some time remaining & we do some math to calculate the time remaining.

The given time in the function parameter / argument is in seconds, so we convert to into years by dividing it by:
(60*60*24*365) second->minute->day->years
suppose we have : 
$deadline as : 1467237600 (30th June 2016) , & the current time as : 1466318222 (19th June 2016 12:21 pm)
then the remainingTime = deadLine - currentTime
					   = 1467237600 - 1466318222
					   = 919378
					   ie, 919378 seconds are remaining to the deadLine.
so, now, the no of years = 919378 / (60*60*24*365) = 0.0291532851
						ie, 0 years are remaining,
we remove the decimal by using floor function (mathematically it is called the greatest integer function)

now, we use the decimal part of the remaining number, to calculate the number of days:
0.0291532851 years have 0.0291532851 * 365 = 10.6409490615 days
						ie, 10 days remaining 
						again, we use floor to remove the decimal
then we subtract the number - floor(number) to obtain the decimal part of it

now , 10.6409490615 - 10 = 0.6409490615 
0.6409490615 days have 0.6409490615 * 24 = 15.382777476 hrs
	ie, 15 hrs
	similarly, remove the decimal , we have
0.382777476 hrs have 0.382777476 * 60 = 22.96664856 mins
	so, 22 mins
remove deci, 
0.96664856 mins have .96664856 * 60 = 57.9989136 secs
so, 57 secs
this is all concanated properly and in proper sequence below to get the output :
15 hrs 22 mins 57 secs.
(the if conditions used here)
eg. if(x) is the same as writing if(x==0), this was done to minimize the code length
the if conditions that are before every concatenation will remove it, if it's value is 0
hence, 0 years is not displayed at all for above although it is calculated.

(remember that there no chance that the answer can be negative, because as sson as we do the subtraction, if -ve then it is returned 0 immediately)



one more major change at welcomePage.php
at line no 91:
the query :	select * from items where type ='B' and status = 'Y';
brings out all the items on the database that are currently approved and are in bidding 
(the items in sale dont have a dead line anyway, and unapproved items are not displayed so they are not checked anyway)

this query is kept at the welcomePage because the project starts from here & this page will be opened certainly by any type of user.
so, the query retreives the desired type of items & checks whether it is past it's deadline or not 
if(deadline < currentTime) <-- this buddy is outdated
so, when that happens,
we change the status of the product to 'D' as in deactivated, setting it as 'N' is not an option because it will show up on the admin's list of approval pending items.
the change is done by a simple update query, so won't have any probs with that
& then finally this item is placed in the order so that it can be sold.
the placeing in order is also a simple query, we set the quantity as 1, because the items in bid are rather rare & we generally bid for a single item only.
this order will show up both in admin and sellerPage as well

there are minor changes in the sellerPage to accomodate the opened and closed bids (simple if queries not much deals)
